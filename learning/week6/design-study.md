# Design Pattern Change Study

Our group chose to focus on food trends. We were struck by how everyone eats kale now, but 5 years ago no one had even heard of it.  Data sources that we thought would be useful included farm output statistics from the Department of Agriculture, grocery sales, and mentions in recipe websites and pinterest/reddit/facebook. Another aspect of food trends that we considered, were related to weather and climate patterns. For example, we considered the drought in California. We thought about how this would affect avocados and almonds supplies and demands in various places such as grocery stores. For this we would look at NOAA data as well as public consumer data. We would want to follow these data over time. We thought a use for this analysis would be to allow farmers to project demand for their crops in choosing what to plant in the future. Another use for this could be to help prevent food waste in the world. This could give the industry more time to prepare for shortages and abundances of different kind of food. Also, emergency response groups could use data like this to respond faster as to perhaps what people in affected areas would need in terms of food.
